## Professional Experience

INDIAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATION | Scientist 2 - Control Dynamics and Simulation Group Sept 2015 - July 2021
PoC: Control & Guidance Design, 6-DOF Simulation S/W Development | Space Docking Experiment C++ • Matlab
• Designed and developed control & guidance scheme for docking & un-docking of two satellites in orbit.
• Led development of 6-DOF simulation software for evaluating Guidance Navigation Control (GNC) performance in rendezvous & docking.
• Developed control-oriented satellite models for sensors, actuators. Non-linear modelling of relative orbital dynamics, spacecraft dynamics & kinematics.
• Designed autonomous features for thruster actuator selection logic and rendezvous & docking sequencer incorporating failure scenarios.
• Carried out comprehensive review of onboard implementation of GNC algorithms as member of GNC Task Team.
• Provided maneuver planning for on-orbit experimental testing of guidance schemes, developed analysis tools to track performance for post-maneuver analysis
